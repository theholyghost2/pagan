This is a page full of things that need to be done, accorded to hackers who
want to work on them.

There is also a TODO.txt file in this directory which contains more programmably
complex features, which need to be done in the way they are escribed there.

NOTES : There will come a document (e.g. a .pod6 file) which describes
all game subsystems, for now look at the file lib/PaganVisions2.pm6
